            <h3>RAHI Pathshala</h3>
            <p>RAHI Pathshala, an initiative of RAHI Foundation, is a community-based school for children of ragpickers and migrant families living in the slums of Gurgaon. These children, aged between 4 and 14 years, often come from families that migrate in search of livelihood and have had little or no access to formal education. RAHI Pathshala provides them with a nurturing learning environment where they receive basic education, moral values, and life skills. Through dedicated teachers and activity-based learning, we aim to ignite curiosity and confidence among these children. </p>

            <h3>Women Empowerment</h3>
            <p>RAHI Foundation’s Women Empowerment Program in Tauru block of NUH district focuses on enhancing the socio-economic status of rural women through form and non-farm livelihood initiatives. The program trains women in sustainable agriculture practices, livestock rearing, agriculture valuadition and other income-generating activities. It encourages women to form self-help groups, build financial literacy, and explore entrepreneurship opportunities. By strengthening their skills and confidence, the initiative enables women to contribute to household income, make informed decisions, and lead community development efforts—creating a pathway toward self-reliance, dignity, and long-term empowerment in rural areas.</p>

            <h3>Natural Farming</h3>
            <p>RAHI Foundation promotes sustainable rural livelihoods through the adoption of Natural Farming practices that are eco-friendly, low-cost, and income-enhancing. The program encourages farmers to shift from chemical-based farming to natural methods using locally available resources like cow dung, cow urine, and bio-inputs. By reducing input costs and improving soil health, farmers achieve better productivity and profitability. Training, field demonstrations, and collective marketing support help farmers strengthen their resilience and earn a dignified livelihood. This initiative not only ensures economic stability but also contributes to environmental sustainability and healthier food systems in rural communities.</p>

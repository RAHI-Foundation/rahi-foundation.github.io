                RAHI Pathshala is a community-based learning initiative for children of ragpickers
                and migrant families living in urban slums. The program provides foundational
                education, moral values, and life skills through activity-based learning and
                personalized attention, helping children build confidence and prepare for
                mainstream education.

            <h3>Women Empowerment</h3>
            <p>
                Our Women Empowerment program focuses on improving the socio-economic status
                of rural women through farm and non-farm livelihood opportunities, skill
                development, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship. The initiative enables
                women to become self-reliant and active contributors to household and community
                development.

                RAHI Foundation promotes Natural Farming practices that are eco-friendly,
                cost-effective, and sustainable. By reducing dependency on chemical inputs and
                improving soil health, farmers enhance productivity, profitability, and long-term
                resilience while contributing to environmental conservation.
